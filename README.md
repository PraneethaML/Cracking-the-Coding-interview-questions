# Cracking-the-Coding-interview-questions

ReplaceString.java :  Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. Assume string has sufficient space at end of string to hold additional characters, and that you're given a true length of a string. I used the books code, implementing the solution in Java using a character array (given the fact that Java Strings are immutable)

Compression.java : Basic string compression using counts of repeated character. eg aabccccaaa = a2b1c5a3

ifUnique: Determine if a string has all unique characters

ifPermutation: Given two strings, determine if they are premutations of each other

isSubstring: asssume we have a method isSubstring which checks if one word is a substring of another. then write a method to check if one string is a rotation of another eg erbottlewat is rotation of waterbottle

MatrixRotation : Rotate an NxN matrix 90 degress clockwise
